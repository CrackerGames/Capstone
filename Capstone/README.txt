As the report points out, do I use the processing libraries. 
This causes most of the classes to be able to be executed, though the project will not run in any other class than the main class.
To run and test the program, do you have to select the "Main_MySketch.java" and execute that.


I used unit testing and just general debugging through the "Testing.java" class to test the project.
Though IntelliJ has a build in testing feature through the test module, could I not get it to work in a good way.
Which is why I decided to test with a test class instead.
